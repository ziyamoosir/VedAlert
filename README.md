# VedAlert
This is VedAlert. An AI-powered system which can predict, detect, and alert location-wise when a disease outbreak happens. This project won Second Prize in a 24-hour national-level hackathon. We are still working on it, and soon, it will be a tool that improves the sustainability of the nation.
